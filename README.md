# Campaign Project

The client server is built with ReactJS and And the backend server is built with NodeJS. Two servers need to be opened to run the project perfectly.

#### [NB: To facilitate the examiner's checking, I have added the environment variable(.env and .env.local) files. Although this is not recommended, But i did it because examiner can quickly run the project without any configuration. If the examiner wants, he can change them according to his own] -- DANGER!

# To run the project:

## Step-1: First you need to clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hnmahamud/campaign-project.git
```

## Step-2: Open the "campaign-server" folder with VS Code and hit these commands in VS Code terminal

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
node index.js
```

After doing these tasks your backend server will run successfully.

## Step-3: Open the "campaign-client" folder with VS Code and hit these commands in VS Code terminal

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

After doing these tasks your client server will run successfully.

## Step-4: Finally check the project

```sh
http://localhost:5173/
```
